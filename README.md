     - A terminal based application I built to assist a friend with creating new folders their web development projects

**Installer**:
    - An Ubuntu based script to restore all packages/configurations after a OS Install

**BGRotater**:
	- Changes the background on your PC via terminal using a folder full of pictures vs GUI
