# Bash Scripts

A compilation of bash scripts I've worked on over the years, some are still useful, A Description of each script is below

> Warning! A lot of these programs are deprecated. Use at own risk.

**backupOS**:
    - Uses rsync to make a mirror image of $USER folder, this copies only the differences and will delete anything that gets deleted, keeping everything

****

**VPNSW** :
    - Switches between London and Washington, DC locations using the PIA CLI

****

**fldrmkr**:
    - A terminal based application I built to assist a friend with creating new folders their web development projects

****

**Installer**:
    - An Ubuntu based script to restore all packages/configurations after a OS Install
	- Makes it way easier to resume where I left off if I have a critical system error that hinders computer performance.
	
****

**BGRotater**:
	- Changes the background on your PC via terminal using a folder full of pictures vs GUI
	- Its randomized so it always gives you a surprise background different from the last (may repeat bg at times).
